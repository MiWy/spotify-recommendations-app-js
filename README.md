# spotify-recommendations-app-js

At this moment this is a very ugly implementation of Spotify API's recommendation query. You can search for recommended tracks based on several criteria (other tracks, artists, genres, popularity, tempo, etc.).
[Check it as a Github page](https://miwy.github.io/spotify-recommendations-app-js/#!/search)

More user-friendly UI will be added later.
